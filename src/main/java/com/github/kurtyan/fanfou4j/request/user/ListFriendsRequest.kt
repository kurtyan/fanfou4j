/**
 * This class is supposed to implement the api described in follow url:
 * https://github.com/FanfouAPI/FanFouAPIDoc/wiki/users.friends
 *
 * However, it's somehow confusing there's a similar under statuses.friend api:
 * https://github.com/FanfouAPI/FanFouAPIDoc/wiki/statuses.friends
 *
 * I'll investigate and deal with later.
